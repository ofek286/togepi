<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
Togepi is an online dispatcher assistance service processing and handling calls for help sent by citizens.

Togepi assistance runs 24/7 waiting for input of any kind (text, voice, images & even coordinations).
processing the messages & forwarding them to our servers running online for further assesment.

once received the servers store the data accordingly for further use of the systems, displaying the correct data on the main dashboard that is being run by the Emergency Call Center Dispatchers.

The dispatchers use the Togepi dashboard for handling calls for help, checking each reported event and all the data that arrived with it from all of the different reports involving the same event.


A list of commonly used resources that I find helpful are listed in the acknowledgements.
